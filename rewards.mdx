## Earn by Running a Node

By running a node, you contribute computing power to serve AI models to the Dria network. Your node earns $DRIA points as it successfully completes inference tasks assigned to it.

Tasks are sent to the network by Dria users, and these users specify which AI model should be used for their task. For example, if many tasks are submitted requesting model 'X', the network distributes these tasks among the available nodes that are currently configured to run model 'X'.

<Info>
  Your node earns points **per completed task**, not continuously. It's completely normal for earnings to fluctuate. If your node status is online on the dashboard and you see occasional point increases, it's working correctly.

### Factors Affecting Earnings

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Task Availability" icon="tasks">
    The number of tasks submitted to the network for the specific model(s) your node is running.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Model Selection" icon="microchip">
    Running models that are in high demand by users will likely result in more tasks being assigned to your node.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Node Performance" icon="gauge-high">
    Your node needs to be online, reachable, and (for local models) performant enough to complete tasks efficiently.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Number of Nodes" icon="network-wired">
    The total number of other nodes also running the same model(s) affects how tasks are distributed.

## Earn by Engaging with Community

In addition to running a node and referring others, there are multiple ways to earn by actively engaging in the Dria ecosystem:

### Discord & X Engagement

Those who actively participate in discussions, share insights, and help onboard new members on Discord & X (Twitter) will be given additional roles to recognize their contributions.

<Check>
  Sharing Dria-related tweets, memes, and threads.

### Special Events & Competitions

We believe that **rewarding contributors should also be an enjoyable experience**. That's why we're going to launch **interactive, gamified events** to engage and incentivize our community.

<Note>
  We **highly value our node runners**, so they'll be our **top priority** when it **comes to rewards**. But those who **actively support us on X and contribute to the community on Discord** **will be just as important!**
</Note>

## Benefits of Early Participation

Early contributors shape the foundation of Dria's decentralized network and will be recognized accordingly in the future.

## Value of $DRIA Points

Dria has been creating real value in the AI world (creating the [first agentic LLM for pythonic function calling](https://x.com/driaforall/status/1878840572737421766), building a launcher for DKN that has 100k+ downloads, got thousands of downloads from AI devs on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/driaforall) etc.) thanks to thousands of contributors across the world. 

$DRIA Points are designed to **incentivize contribution and participation, while allowing contributors to have an exposure to the value Dria is creating in the AI space.**
