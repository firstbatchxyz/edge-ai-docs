## Earn by Running a Node

By running a node, you contribute computing power to serve AI models to the Dria network. Your node earns $DRIA points as it successfully completes inference tasks assigned to it.

Tasks are sent to the network by Dria users, and these users specify which AI model should be used for their task. For example, if many tasks are submitted requesting model 'X', the network distributes these tasks among the available nodes that are currently configured to run model 'X'.

<Info>
  Your node earns points **per completed task**, not continuously. It's completely normal for earnings to fluctuate. If your node status is online on the dashboard and you see occasional point increases, it's working correctly.

### Factors Affecting Earnings

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Task Availability" icon="tasks">
    The number of tasks submitted to the network for the specific model(s) your node is running.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Model Selection" icon="microchip">
    Running models that are in high demand by users will likely result in more tasks being assigned to your node.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Node Performance" icon="gauge-high">
    Your node needs to be online, reachable, and (for local models) performant enough to complete tasks efficiently.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Number of Nodes" icon="network-wired">
    The total number of other nodes also running the same model(s) affects how tasks are distributed.

## Earn by Referring Dria

Invite your friends and community to run Dria nodes and earn additional $DRIA Points through our Referral Program. Plus, stay activeâ€”there will be special airdrops rewarding our most engaged community members.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get a Referral Code">
    Run `dkn-compute-launcher referrals` command to get your referral code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share Your Code">
    Share your referral code with friends and community.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Earn Points">
    Once someone registers using your referral code, you'll earn additional points based on their activity:
    - 0.3 rate for their first 10,000 $DRIA Points
    - 0.2 rate up to 100,000 $DRIA Points
    - 0.1 rate for all $DRIA Points beyond 100,000
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Each referral code only has 10 uses! Once you have referred 10 users, your code will no longer work.
</Warning>

## Earn by Engaging with Community

In addition to running a node and referring others, there are multiple ways to earn by actively engaging in the Dria ecosystem:

### Discord & X Engagement

Those who actively participate in discussions, share insights, and help onboard new members on Discord & X (Twitter) will be given additional roles to recognize their contributions.

<Check>
  Sharing Dria-related tweets, memes, and threads.

<Check>
  Engaging with the community, answering questions, and fostering discussions.

## Value of $DRIA Points

Dria has been creating real value in the AI world (creating the [first agentic LLM for pythonic function calling](https://x.com/driaforall/status/1878840572737421766), building a launcher for DKN that has 100k+ downloads, got thousands of downloads from AI devs on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/driaforall) etc.) thanks to thousands of contributors across the world. 

$DRIA Points are designed to **incentivize contribution and participation, while allowing contributors to have an exposure to the value Dria is creating in the AI space.** 


## Special Events & Competitions

We believe that **rewarding contributors should also be an enjoyable experience**. That's why we're going to launch **interactive, gamified events** to engage and incentivize our community.

<Note>
  We **highly value our node runners**, so they'll be our **top priority** when it **comes to rewards**. But those who **actively support us on X and contribute to the community on Discord** **will be just as important!**
</Note>

## Benefits of Early Participation

Early contributors shape the foundation of Dria's decentralized network and will be recognized accordingly in the future.

### Early Contributor Appreciation Program

We're excited to announce our Early Contributor Appreciation Program as a way to thank our dedicated node operators who have actively contributed to Dria's growth and success.

<Info>
  This program is not related to any future token launches or $DRIA tokens. Dria currently has no token, and this appreciation event is purely to recognize your early support and enthusiasm.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Timeline:** We plan to launch this program before the end of May 2025. There isn't a strict deadline yet, as we're focused on completing development. We'll announce the official launch date once it's ready.
</Warning>

Your accumulated $DRIA Points will remain unaffected by this program and will still count toward future incentives once Dria becomes a completely decentralized protocol.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Earn $DRIA Points">
    Your node earns points by successfully completing tasks on the network.
    The conversion rate is fixed: 1 $DRIA Point = 0.00001 USDC
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly Reward Pool">
    At the end of each 30-day cycle, we calculate all $DRIA Points earned across the network and create a Reward Pool with the equivalent USDC value.
    
    For example, if the network collectively earns 100,000,000 $DRIA Points in a month, the reward pool receives 1,000 USDC.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meet Eligibility Requirements">
    To qualify for rewards, you'll need to collect at least **1,000,000 $DRIA Points** during the 30-day period.
    
    This threshold may be adjusted periodically based on network activity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Your Share">
    Eligible node operators receive rewards proportional to their contribution, with a maximum of **10 USDC** per operator per cycle.
    
    Your reward is calculated as:
    $$
    \text{Your Reward} = \min\left(\frac{\text{Your Points}}{\text{Total Qualified Points}} \times \text{Reward Pool}, \text{10 USDC}\right)
    $$
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If the total rewards distributed are less than the amount available in the Reward Pool, the surplus rolls over to the next cycle, increasing the next month's Reward Pool.
</Note>

### Distribution Process

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Claiming Rewards" icon="wallet">
    Rewards will be distributed to the wallet address connected to your node at the end of each cycle.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verification" icon="magnifying-glass">
    All reward calculations will be shared transparently via our community channels for operators to verify.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Timeline" icon="calendar">
    The first reward cycle begins on July 1, 2023, with distributions occurring within 10 days after cycle completion.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reporting" icon="chart-bar">
    Monthly reports will detail total points earned, reward pool size, and distribution metrics.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Why?

<Warning>
  Dria's goal is to foster genuine participation through meaningful tasks rather than speculative activity. This program directly links rewards to actual work performed on the network.
</Warning>

By rewarding node operators based on their contributions proportional to network revenue, we're building a sustainable incentive model that benefits both the network and our dedicated community of node runners.
