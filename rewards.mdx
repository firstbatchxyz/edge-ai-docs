## Earn by Running a Node

By running a node, you contribute computing power to serve AI models to the Dria network. Your node earns $DRIA points as it successfully completes inference tasks assigned to it.

Tasks are sent to the network by Dria users, and these users specify which AI model should be used for their task. For example, if many tasks are submitted requesting model 'X', the network distributes these tasks among the available nodes that are currently configured to run model 'X'.

<Info>
  Your node earns points **per completed task**, not continuously. It's completely normal for earnings to fluctuate. If your node status is online on the dashboard and you see occasional point increases, it's working correctly.
</Info>


### Factors Affecting Earnings

## Value of $DRIA Points

Dria has been creating real value in the AI world (creating the [first agentic LLM for pythonic function calling](https://x.com/driaforall/status/1878840572737421766), building a launcher for DKN that has 100k+ downloads, got thousands of downloads from AI devs on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/driaforall) etc.) thanks to thousands of contributors across the world. 

$DRIA Points are designed to **incentivize contribution and participation, while allowing contributors to have an exposure to the value Dria is creating in the AI space.** 


## Special Events & Competitions

We believe that **rewarding contributors should also be an enjoyable experience**. That's why we're going to launch **interactive, gamified events** to engage and incentivize our community.

<Note>
  We **highly value our node runners**, so they'll be our **top priority** when it **comes to rewards**. But those who **actively support us on X and contribute to the community on Discord** **will be just as important!**
</Note>

## Benefits of Early Participation

Early contributors shape the foundation of Dria's decentralized network and will be recognized accordingly in the future.

### Early Contributor Appreciation Program

We're excited to announce our Early Contributor Appreciation Program as a way to thank our dedicated node operators who have actively contributed to Dria's growth and success.

<Info>
  This program is not related to any future token launches or $DRIA tokens. Dria currently has no token, and this appreciation event is purely to recognize your early support and enthusiasm.
</Info>

<Note>
  **Important:** This Early Contributor Appreciation Program is an **additional reward layer** separate from your DRIA Points. When you claim rewards from this program, **your DRIA Points remain completely intact** and are not consumed or reduced in any way. Your points will continue to be available for all future incentive programs and protocols. This is purely bonus appreciation on top of your existing point balance.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Timeline:** The program launches with the first payout on **July 10th**. This marks the beginning of our monthly reward distribution cycles for active node contributors.
</Warning>

Your accumulated $DRIA Points will remain unaffected by this program and will still count toward future incentives once Dria becomes a completely decentralized protocol.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Earn $DRIA Points">
    Your node earns points by successfully completing tasks on the network. All your accumulated points across time contribute to your total score.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Eligibility & Point Calculation">
    Only nodes that have been **active within the last 30 days** are eligible for rewards. However, the calculation uses **all-time points** earned by these active nodes, not just points from the last 30 days.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Pool Creation">
    The **total reward pool** is calculated by multiplying the **combined points of all eligible nodes** by **0.000025 USD**. This creates the USD value of the pool that will be distributed among all participants.
    
    For example, if eligible nodes have a combined total of 100,000,000 $DRIA Points, the total reward pool will be 2,500 USD worth of USDT to be shared among all eligible nodes.
    
    <Warning>
      **Important:** Your individual points are NOT directly multiplied by 0.000025. This formula only determines the size of the shared reward pool in USD value.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Percentile Distribution">
    Among eligible nodes, participants are ranked by their total points and divided into percentiles. **Only the top 5 percentiles receive rewards:**
    
    - **Top 10%**: 25% of reward pool
    - **Top 20%**: 22% of reward pool  
    - **Top 30%**: 20% of reward pool
    - **Top 40%**: 17% of reward pool
    - **Top 50%**: 16% of reward pool
    
    <Info>
      **Note:** Nodes ranking below the top 50% percentile do not receive rewards in this program.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Individual Rewards">
    Within each percentile group, rewards are distributed proportionally based on each node's share of points within that group.
    
    **Your actual reward calculation:**
    Your reward = (Your points / Total points in your percentile) × (Your percentile's % of total pool) × (Total reward pool in USD)
    
    <Info>
      **Example:** If you're in the top 10% with 5,000,000 points, your percentile has 50,000,000 total points, and the total pool is 2,500 USD:
      Your reward = (5,000,000 / 50,000,000) × 20% × 2,500 USD = 50 USD worth of USDT
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Important:** These distribution ratios apply specifically to the **first payout starting July 10th**. For subsequent monthly payouts, the reward pool will be calculated using only the last 30 days' points, and distribution ratios will be adjusted based on the active node distribution patterns.
</Warning>

### Distribution Process

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Claiming Rewards" icon="wallet">
    Rewards are calculated in **USD value** but distributed as **USDT equivalent** and can be claimed by logging into the [dria.co/edge-ai](https://dria.co/edge-ai) dashboard with the wallet address connected to your node.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verification" icon="magnifying-glass">
    All reward calculations will be shared transparently via our community channels for operators to verify their percentile placement and reward allocation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Timeline" icon="calendar">
    The first reward cycle begins on **July 10th** with the initial payout. Subsequent cycles will occur monthly with adjusted distribution ratios.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reporting" icon="chart-bar">
    Monthly reports will detail total points earned, reward pool size (in USD), percentile distributions, and individual reward allocations (USDT equivalent values).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Why?

<Warning>
  Dria's goal is to foster genuine participation through meaningful tasks rather than speculative activity. This program directly links rewards to actual work performed on the network.
</Warning>

By rewarding node operators based on their contributions proportional to network revenue, we're building a sustainable incentive model that benefits both the network and our dedicated community of node runners.
