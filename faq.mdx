## Running Multiple Nodes

<Warning>
  You can run multiple nodes under the same IP address or Wi-Fi network, **but you must use a unique private key (wallet) for each node instance.** Using the same private key for multiple active nodes can lead to conflicts and issues with task assignment and rewards.
</Warning>

## Avoid Using WSL

If you're using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), please avoid it for running the Dria node launcher. It is known to cause compatibility issues.

Instead, open a native Windows terminal (like CMD or PowerShell) **as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://dria.co/launcher.ps1 | iex"
```

## System Requirements

<Accordion title="What are the minimum system requirements?">
  Your system needs to be powerful enough to achieve at least **15 Eval TPS** for the specific model you choose. All models are served locally using Ollama. Refer to the **[Selecting Models](/selecting-models)** page for performance benchmarks on various hardware configurations.
</Accordion>

## Node Status

<Accordion title="How do I check if my node is online and working?">
  Visit the [Dria Edge AI Dashboard](https://dria.co/edge-ai) and log in with the wallet associated with your node. The dashboard shows your node's status (Online/Offline), recent activity, and earned points. If the status is "Online" and you see points accumulating (even if intermittently), your node is working.
</Accordion>

## Earning Points

<Accordion title="Why am I not earning points?">
  There could be several reasons:
  
  1. **No tasks:** There might be low demand for the specific model(s) your node is running. Check the dashboard and consider switching to more active models.
  
  2. **Node offline:** Ensure your node is running and connected to the internet. Check the dashboard for its status.
  
  3. **Performance issues:** Ensure your system meets the performance requirements (>= 15 Eval TPS). Use `dkn-compute-launcher measure`.

  4. **Network Issues:** Firewalls or network configurations might prevent your node from communicating effectively. Ensure the required ports (default 4001) are open.
  
  Refer to the **[Rewards](/rewards)** page for more details on the earning mechanism.
</Accordion>

## Ollama Requirements

<Accordion title="Do I need Ollama installed?">
  Yes. All models are served locally via Ollama, so you must have Ollama installed on your system.
</Accordion>

## Points Updates

<Accordion title="How often are $DRIA Points updated?">
  Points shown on the [Dria Edge AI Dashboard](https://dria.co/edge-ai) are updated in near real-time as your node successfully completes tasks.
</Accordion>

## Performance Metrics

<Accordion title="What is TPS?">
  TPS stands for **Tokens Per Second**. It's a common metric used to measure the processing speed of AI models. In the context of Dria and the `measure` command, we primarily look at **Eval TPS** to determine if a local Ollama model is fast enough to participate effectively in the network (generally >= 15 TPS).
